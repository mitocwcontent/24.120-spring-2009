  image-alt: 'Photograph of the sculpture Human/Need/Desire, 1983, by Bruce Nauman.
    Nauman uses neon tubing to spell out the words of fundamental human experience.
    The words are arranged as a six-point, radiating star starting with dream on the
    lower left and arranged counter-clockwise: dream, need, human, human, desire,
    and hope.'
